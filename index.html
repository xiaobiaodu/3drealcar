          <h2>About</h2>
          
          <p>The advancement of 3D reconstruction encourages researchers to reconstruct vehicles from large-scale self-driving datasets for the simulation of corner-case scenes, like vehicle accidents. 
            However, the reconstructed 3D cars are typically low-quality and suffer from numerous artifacts due to insufficient training views and the lack of high-resolution images. 
            Therefore, there is an imperative need for a dataset capable of reconstructing high-quality 3D cars for the simulation of corner-case scenes. 
            </p>
            <br>

          <p>
            In this paper, we propose the first large-scale 3D real car dataset, termed 3DRealCar, offering three distinctive features: 
            (1)High-Volume: The dataset comprises 2500 cars meticulously scanned by 3D scanners to obtain point cloud representing their real-world dimension. 
            (2)High-Quality: Each car is captured with an average of 200 dense, high-resolution 360-degree views, enabling high-fidelity 3D reconstruction.
            (3)High-Diversity: The dataset contains diverse car characteristics, encompassing six various car types in over twenty colors. 
            More importantly, these cars are collected under three distinct lighting conditions, such as reflective, standard, and dark. 

          </p>
          <br>

          <p>
            To ensure the reconstruction only on the car, we design a pipeline to remove background point clouds and standardize the car orientation to a unified axis.
             This process facilitates more accurate 3D reconstruction and enables the control of rendered views.
              We benchmark 3D reconstruction results with state-of-the-art methods across each lighting condition in 3DRealCar.
               Notably, our dataset brings insight that recent 3D reconstruction methods face significant challenges when reconstructing 3D cars under reflective and dark lighting conditions. 
                Extensive experiments demonstrate the standard lighting condition within 3DRealCar enables the reconstruction of high-quality 3D cars for the later simulation of photorealistic corner-case scenes and improves performances in car-related tasks. 
                We anticipate this dataset will contribute to advancing 3D reconstruction and car-related tasks. Our dataset is available here.

          <h2>Distributions</h2>
            <p>Our dataset mainly contains six different car types.
             We also count the number of different lighting conditions on cars.
              the standard condition means the car is well-lighting and without strong specular highlights.
              The reflective condition means the car has specular highlights.
              Glossy materials bring huge challenges to recent 3D reconstruction methods.
              The dark condition means the car is captured in an underground parking and not well-lighting.
              The number of captured images per car is an average of 200. The number of views ranges from 50 to 400.
              Our dataset contains more than twenty colors, but the white and black colors still take up most of our dataset.
              In addition, we also show the distribution of car size, in terms of their length, width, and height.  </p>

          <h2>Reconstructed Results</h2>
            <p>We show visualization in our dataset with recent state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction method, 3DGS (Gaussian Splatting).
                To the standard lighting condition,  3DGS is capable of reconstructing relatively high-quality 3D cars from our dataset.
                Note that this level of reconstructing quality is enough to be utilized and rendered for downstream tasks.
                However, the reflective and dark conditions results are not promising.
                Therefore, these two parts of our 3DRealCar bring two challenges to recent 3D methods. </p>
            <br>

                <p>The first challenge is the reconstruction of specular highlights.
                Due to the particular property of cars, materials of car surfaces are generally glossy,
                which means it would produce plenty of specular highlights if cars are exposed to the sun or strong light. </p>
            <br>

                <p>The second challenge is the reconstruction in a dark environment.
                The training images captured in the dark environment lost plenty of details for reconstruction.
                Therefore, how to achieve high-quality reconstruction results from these two extremely lighting conditions is a challenge
                to recent methods. </p>

            <br>
                <p>We hope these results can encourage subsequent research for the 3D reconstruction in awful conditions. </p>
